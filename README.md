# 📙 DeepFace Embedding Generator
Generating embedding from face is one of the important task in a Face Recognition and Verification projects. Here we have used MTCNN for face detection and FaceNet archietecture for generating face embedding. It is a API based application that takes input as image path and would give response as an embedding list. This feature can be intergrated in a large scale projects.
